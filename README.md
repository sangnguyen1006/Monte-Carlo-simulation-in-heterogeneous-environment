# BUILDING A MONTE CARLO PROGRAM SIMULATING THE TRANSPORT OF LIGHT IN HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA USING MATLAB
The Monte Carlo technique is an universal computational method for simulating the
propagation of radiation in a substance medium. The simulation is based on the light model,
which is a collection of photons traveling with random steps governed by physical laws
corresponding to radiation features and media properties. The steps are selected by
statistical sampling of the probability distributions for the step size and angular deviation
on each scattering event. After propagating many photons, the distribution of all photon
paths gives an exact approximation to reality. Monte Carlo simulations have been
considered as the gold standard for estimating the results of other computational methods.

This study builds a 3D Monte Carlo simulation program of light transport in biological
tissues using the Matlab computational tool. The program uses the algorithm of the
programs MCML and mcxyz. Building simulation algorithms on Matlab simplifies
operations for users, adds flexible graphical tools, and provides basic models for training
and research purposes.

An illustrative simulation of the apple model was performed to examine the
propagation of light through normal and bruised apple tissue. The simulation provides the
distribution matrices of the absorbed energy W and the energy flux of the transmitted light
in the tissue and also records the diffuse/transmitted reflectance spectrum as the light exits
the tissue surface. The above results were produced by irradiating a gaussian light beam
and a narrow beam of 650 nm.
